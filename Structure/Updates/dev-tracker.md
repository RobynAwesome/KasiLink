# Dev Activity Tracker

> Normalized in Schematics by `Structure/Schematics/04-Updates/06-Collaboration Protocol.md` and `Structure/Schematics/04-Updates/07-Truth Register.md`.
> Keep this file as a historical activity ledger. Route counts, role names, and task status snapshots below should not be treated as current canonical truth.

> **Color Code:** 🟢 Done | 🟡 In Progress | 🔴 Blocked/Failed | ⚪ Not Started | 🔵 Lead Action
> **Rule:** Every check-in gets a timestamp. Devs tick off their checklist items here. Lead updates on every review.
