# KasiLink Technical Specifications - Detail Companion

> **Source of truth:** [../technical-Specifications.md](../technical-Specifications.md)
> **Purpose:** A shorter companion spec for execution planning, design alignment, and feature scoping.

## Mission in One Line

KasiLink connects township job seekers, small businesses, and verified providers through mobile-first gigs, trust signals, community content, and utility awareness.

## What This Note Is For

- Quick context before starting a task.
- A readable bridge between the mission spec and the active work files.
- A simpler execution version of the mission without dropping important detail.
- A stable clarification note for reviewers who need route, data, and documentation context without reading the entire vault.

## Product Pillars

### Critical

- <span style="color:#dc2626">Instant local work</span> - nearby gig discovery, posting, and applications.
- <span style="color:#dc2626">Trust and safety</span> - verified providers, ratings, reporting, and profile context.

### High

- <span style="color:#ea580c">Community utility support</span> - load-shedding, water alerts, incidents, and schedule visibility.
- <span style="color:#ea580c">Community identity</span> - forum, calendar, spotlight, and success stories.

### Medium

- <span style="color:#ca8a04">Mobile-first access</span> - PWA, low-data UI, responsive layout, offline fallback.

## Execution Priorities

1. Keep the core marketplace stable.
2. Keep community and trust flows visible and honest.
3. Keep utility information timely and lightweight.
4. Keep the UI usable on slow Android connections.
5. Keep documentation and coordination files aligned with what is actually built.

## Folder Guidance

- `app/` contains the product surfaces.
- `app/api/` contains route handlers.
- `components/` contains reusable UI blocks.
- `lib/` contains data, validation, models, and utilities.
- `Structure/Information/` contains source-backed reference material.
- `Structure/Updates/` contains planning, coordination, and history.

## Fit Rules

- If the note describes what the product is, put it in the mission spec.
- If the note describes what to do next, put it in Updates.
- If the note explains a fact source, put it in Information.
- If the note explains a screen or interaction, put it in Design.
- If the note explains a bug or regression, put it in Issues.
